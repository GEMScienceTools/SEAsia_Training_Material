# the GMPEs defined in the 'gmpe_logic_tree.xml' depend on vs30 only,

# official calculations are done for the B/C site conditions, corresponding
# to a vs30 value equal to 760. We use here a value a equal to 770 because
# for the Atkinson and Boore 2003 GMPE the B/C site conditions are computed
# when vs30 is strictly greater than 760. Anyhow the absolute values does not
# matter as long as it is in the range corresponding to B/C conditions
# (Youngs et al. 1997: vs30 >= 760, Zhao et al. 2006: 600 < vs30 <= 1100,
# Atkinson and Boore 2003: vs30 > 760)
